You can thus contribute to ADE Scheduler while also validating some ECTS for you studies!<br><br> The first one, <a href='https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2020-lingi2401'>LINGI2401 \"Open Source strategy for software development\"</a>, is given during the first semester and asks for a very small contribution. We highly recommend this course as a good introduction to open source and it is worth 5 ECTS.<br><br> The second one, <a href='https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2020-lingi2402'>LINGI2402 \"Open Source Project\"</a>, can be taken during either the first or the second semester and asks for a contribution worth 140h of work. This course can be accounted as an internship and it is worth 5 ECTS.<br><br> In the case you cannot, or do not want to, follow these courses, contributing to an open source project is definitely an added value to your CV. Even if it is a vey small contribution, such as typo correction, we will learn a lot from that! "
