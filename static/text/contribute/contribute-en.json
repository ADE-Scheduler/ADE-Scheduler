Instead of using emails, use GitHub <a href='https://github.com/SnaKyEyeS/ADE-Scheduler/issues'>issues</a> when you want to report a problem or ask for new feature, and <a href='https://github.com/SnaKyEyeS/ADE-Scheduler/pulls'>pull requests</a> when you want us to review your code and later include it in the tool. If you want to contribute but you do not have a specific idea in mind, it is good pratice to read the issues other people have written to see if you can help. <br><br> Even if you do not plan to contribute to the code, we highly recommend people who know git or GitHub to reach us via our GitHub repository as it allows us to centralize questions and keep a record of them. <br><br> Last but not least, we have written a complete documentation available <a href='https://ade-scheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>ici</a> to help you understand our code and contribute.

You can thus contribute to ADE Scheduler while also validating some ECTS for you studies!<br><br> The first one, <a href='https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2020-lingi2401'>LINGI2401 \"Open Source strategy for software development\"</a>, is given during the first semester and asks for a very small contribution. We highly recommend this course as a good introduction to open source and it is worth 5 ECTS.<br><br> The second one, <a href='https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2020-lingi2402'>LINGI2402 \"Open Source Project\"</a>, can be taken during either the first or the second semester and asks for a contribution worth 140h of work. This course can be accounted as an internship and it is worth 5 ECTS.<br><br> In the case you cannot, or do not want to, follow these courses, contributing to an open source project is definitely an added value to your CV. Even if it is a vey small contribution, such as typo correction, we will learn a lot from that! "
