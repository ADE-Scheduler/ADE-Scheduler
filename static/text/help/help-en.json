The tool named compute tries all the possible combinations of picking one event of each type, every week, in order to find the 5 bests schedules which minimize the conflicts. If you want to be free during a given period, make sure to create a custom event to block this period of time. You can also remove some events before calling the compute function, to not take them into account. Because the compute function optimizes week per week, not all weeks must be the same. If you need to need to attend the same events every week, we encourage you to pick the week that suits your need from the results given by the compute tool and then manually select the events in your main schedule.
