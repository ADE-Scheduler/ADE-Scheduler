However, it is not an official tool provided by the UCLouvain and the EPL.

Our Forbidden Time Slots ("FTS") system provides a way for the user to specify when he would like to be free. There are three level of priority you can pick from: low, medium and high. The higher the priority, the harder the scheduling algorithm tries to free a time slot from any university events. However, it does not guaranty that it will be able to find a way around your specifications and wishes. To add a FTS, you simply need to pick one and drag it onto the calendar, at the day you wish to be free. You will then have to specify a start and end time. Once your FTS is created, you can move it around by dragging it and you can even duplicate it (in case your indisponibility would be a recurring event) by pressing the ALT key and dragging it. If you made a mistake, you can easily delete a FTS by clicking on it with the SHIFT key pressed.') }}
