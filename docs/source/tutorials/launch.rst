.. launch info begin

Almost there ! Once you proceeded to the above installation steps, you can now
run the following command in your terminal to run the project. Make sure that
you are still in the virtual environment.

.. code-block:: console

    $ flask run

.. note::

    It is recommended to copy the above command lines (i.e., virtual environment activation,
    database initialization, redis-server startup, flask launch) in an executable script
    in order to facilitate the project launch for the next times. You can check the
    'docker/entrypoint.sh' file for some inspiration.


Your terminal should now display a page url that you can access with your browser. This
is your local version of the app!


.. launch info end
