# Contributing

Any contribution is welcome. If you would like to fix a bug or add a feature, you can
do it ! However, it is important to follow some guidelines so that everything can go
smoothly.

If you have an idea or a bug, please report it first in the [Issues](https://github.com/SnaKyEyeS/ADE-Scheduler/issues) tab of the repository so we can discuss it and decide of the best strategy to bring your idea to life. Directly issuing a pull request is generally a bad idea: you might end up coding something that has already been done or is being done.
